# LaunchXL-CC2642R1_Sandbox

A repository for my LaunchXL-CC22642R1 development board (https://www.ti.com/tool/LAUNCHXL-CC26X2R1) and its related projects.

For now you will only find code mostly created through the sample projects from TI's Resource Explorer (https://dev.ti.com/tirex/).

The current projects are simple explorations of TI-RTOS and TI's BLE Stack.

Things might get interesting in the future...
